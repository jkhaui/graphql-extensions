<strong>Instructions:</strong>

1. Download the zip file

2. Install it like any other plugin (either through the WP admin panel, or uploading into your plugins folder via FTP and unzipping).
Note that you must have WooCommerce and WP GraphQL (https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql) installed.

** This plugin assumes WP GraphQL is installed on your server under the path /wp-graphql-develop/wp-graphql.php. Otherwise it will throw an error, so check your plugins folder for /wp-graphql/ directory if this happens. Need to find a better way to check for dependencies **
