# Modernise your plugins and make them compatible with a decoupled CMS/SPA.
Bootstrap the datasource of your decoupled SPA. These extensions make popular WordPress plugins compatible with GraphQL, allowing you to leverage their backend functionality only. Particularly suitable for ecommerce and social network-based apps, or any plugin that potentially exposes a lot of data.

<strong>Instructions for installing GraphQL add-on plugins:</strong>

1. Download the repo
2. Zip whichever folder/s you wish to use.
3. Install the Zip file as you would with any other plugin.

Alternative if you are lazy: copy and paste the code for a given plugin into your theme's functions.php file.

<em>Note that all plugins here require the WP GraphQL plugin (https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql) to be installed.</em>
