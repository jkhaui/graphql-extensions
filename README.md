# graphql-extensions
<strong>GraphQL provides arguably the best API architecture for highly relational datasets.</strong> WordPress, meanwhile, is powered by over 50,000 plugins - many of which make extensive use of the WP database.

Some great work has been done by the contributers to the WP GraphQL plugin. However, at the time of writing, there are virtually no repositories for plugins that help to expose other plugins to the GraphQL schema.

<strong>This repo attempts to change that. Feel free to submit any extenders you may have created :)</strong>

<strong>Instructions:</strong>

1. Download the repo
2. Zip whichever folder/s you wish to use.
3. Install the Zip file as you would with any other plugin.

<em>Note that all plugins here require the WP GraphQL plugin (https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql) to be installed as a dependency.</em>
